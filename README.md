# Crime Rate Analysis Project
This repository contains a comprehensive project on crime data analysis using Apache Spark and machine learning. The analysis leverages PySpark and PySpark Streaming for data processing and machine learning techniques for insights and predictions. The project also includes deployment guidelines for running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Project Overview
The project focuses on analyzing crime data sourced from the **Kansas City Police Department (KCPD)** dataset. The workflow is structured to clean, process, analyze, and deploy the data analysis pipeline using PySpark.

## Workflow Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess the raw data to handle missing values, standardize formats, and remove any anomalies.
2. **PySpark Processing**: Use PySpark to load and process the data for efficient distributed computation.
3. **PySpark Streaming**: Implement PySpark Streaming to handle real-time data streams and update analyses dynamically.
4. **Data Analytics**: Apply machine learning models to derive patterns, predict crime rates, and provide actionable insights.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the solution on GCP for scalable analysis and availability.

## Steps to Execute Locally
1. **Upload the KCPD Dataset**:
   - Place the KCPD dataset in your Jupyter Notebook directory.
   - Load the dataset into the notebook for preprocessing.
2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Use the `Run All` function in Jupyter Notebook to execute the complete workflow.
3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Perform data cleaning operations such as handling null values, data type conversions, and formatting.
4. **PySpark Processing**:
   - Load the cleaned data into PySpark.
   - Apply transformations and actions to prepare data for analysis.
5. **PySpark Streaming**:
   - Simulate streaming data or connect to a real-time data source to test PySpark Streaming functionalities.
6. **Analytics and ML Modeling**:
   - Utilize Spark MLlib for feature engineering and training machine learning models to predict trends and analyze crime rates.
7. **Visualization**:
   - Create visual representations of data insights using tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Deployment on GCP
### Prerequisites
- **Google Cloud SDK**: Installed and configured.
- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**: Bucket for storing data and outputs.
- **Dataproc Cluster**: A cluster configured for running Spark jobs.

### Steps for Deployment
1. **Create a GCS Bucket**:
   - Go to the GCP Console and create a bucket to store your data and scripts.
2. **Set Up a Dataproc Cluster**:
   - Create a Dataproc cluster to run Spark jobs.
   - Ensure the cluster has the necessary compute resources for your job.
3. **Convert Jupyter Notebooks to Python Scripts**:
   - Use the `nbconvert` tool:
     ```bash
     jupyter nbconvert --to script your_notebook.ipynb
     ```
   - This converts `.ipynb` files into `.py` scripts.
4. **Upload Scripts to GCS**:
   - Upload the converted Python scripts and required data files to your GCS bucket.
5. **Submit the Job**:
   - Submit the job to Dataproc with the following command:
     ```bash
     gcloud dataproc jobs submit pyspark gs://your-bucket/your_script.py --cluster your-cluster-name --region your-region --files gs://your-bucket/requirements.txt
     ```
   - Ensure the `requirements.txt` file lists all dependencies, including PySpark and MLlib.


## Technologies Used
- **Apache Spark**: For big data processing and streaming.
- **PySpark**: For writing Spark applications using Python.
- **Spark Streaming**: For processing real-time data streams.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: For scalable deployment using Dataproc and GCS.
- **Machine Learning**: Spark MLlib for data modeling and prediction.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate more real-time data sources for continuous analysis.
- Enhance the machine learning models for higher accuracy.
- Automate deployment pipelines using tools such as Terraform or Jenkins.


This repository serves as a guide and resource for anyone interested in crime data analysis using Spark and deploying scalable data processing pipelines on GCP.
